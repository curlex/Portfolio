Skippy brief

Everything works. 

- Grid Class -
The initialiser for this class takes in a variable size
to determine the size of the grid which is obtained from main, 
which asks the user for the input.

- Kangaroo -
The initialiser takes in an instance of grid that is used in main. Creates an
initial position for the kangaroo that is a point object set to (0,0).
Also variable for number of hops set to 0.

:Method hop!
This method changes the kangaroos position to the point sent to it.
It increases the number of hops as well.

:Method move
This method takes a point to move to, adds it to kangaroos position and checks 
if its within the boundaries by sending it to grid class's method out_of_bounds
If its within bounds then hop! method is called with the position to move to.

- Die class -
The initialiser of this class creates 4 new points, north, east,north and west set to 
point objects.

:Method throw
This method gets a random number between 1-4 and based on this number a position 
to move to is selected.
